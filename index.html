Most people know that steakhouses slather their steak in salt to get that charred, crusty exterior that seals in all the juices and flavor, but give yourself enough time for it to properly set. "Besides the salt adding flavor, it draws moisture, which causes the salt to dissolve," Old Homestead Steakhouse executive chef Martinez told Business Insider. "Letting the salted steaks sit for at least 45 minutes allows the moisture to return into the meat. The salt makes a sumptuous crust on the exterior when it hits the grill."</p>
